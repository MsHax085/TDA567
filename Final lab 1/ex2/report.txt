Insert contains a bug.
	The break statements inside the if clauses causes the
	function to add the element an additional time at the end
	even if if wasn't supposed to.
	
	Replacing break with return fixes this bug.

Member contains no bug.
	
Section contains a bug.
	When the if (a.get(i).equals(s.a.get(j))) is true it is supposed
	to remove the element as it does but shouldn't increment index i
	since the array size is decreased thus increment of index i is
	unneccessary.
	
	Removing i++ under the first if-node fixes this bug.
	
containsArithTriple contains a bug.
	The bug manifests itself because X-Y=Y-Z -> X=2Y-Z, with values
	{X,Y,Z} when index i,j=0 the condition of the if-statement will
	always return true because member(2 * a.get(i) - a.get(j)) will
	always check if the first element X is member of the set {X,Y,Z}
	which always be true. So it doesn't matter what values you try to
	build a test suite of, you won't be able to get Statement Coverage
	this itself is an indication of the presence of the bug.
	
	Changing the loop condition in the second for-node to j < i fixes this bug.
